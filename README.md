# Arduino To Processing Serial Communication Example

This repository contains two folders :
- ArduinoSerialSender is an Arduino file that can send a subset of the 6 analog sensors via serial in an osc style
- ProcessingSerialReceiver is a Processing sketch that receives messages from the Arduino firmware and parses them to fill a normalized ArrayList of floats.
